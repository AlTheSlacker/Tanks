# Tanks
A short demo of how a player might control rigidbody movement. Contains a simple terrain, a player capsule and a simulated player to interact with.
 
This is a basic demonstrator to answer a question from the Unity Physics forum, but feel free to so whatever you like with it. I recommend using the physics solver "Temporal Gauss Seidel" due to the partial rigidbody rotational freeze constraints. This should already be set in the project.

Have fun.
